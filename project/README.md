# Student-Athlete Scheduler

## Description:

As a student athlete, finding and keeping track of the time you need to maintain success can be very difficult. This
application is designed to assist in scheduling for student-athletes. Academically, the application will help manage
time to complete assignments and study for tests, and will integrate one's course schedule. Athletically, the
application will help to keep track of sleep, nutrition, practices, workouts and recovery sessions.

This application will be able to keep track of:

- assignments and their due dates
- exam dates
- gym sessions
- practises
- daily nutrition
- recovery and daily sleep habits

## The Average User:

This scheduler is optimized for student-athletes but could be used by anyone with a busy schedule and an active
lifestyle.

## About Me:

This project interests me because I am a student-athlete who finds it difficult to keep track of all the components that
comprise being a student athlete. I play football, and I am hoping to major in computer science.

### Phase 4: Task 3
The design in my project is quite basic, but it is also functional. In my GUI, my design could have been more
organized, and, because it isn't split into multiple classes, the ScheduleApp class is quite long.

- The biggest change I would make in my project design-wise would be to better organize the implementation of my GUI.
